          <li>biggest hobby is reading online novel. I've been reading about 15 million words of online novels every year,for more than 15 years📖</li>
          <li>now have a cool Mexican black king snake😎 as my pet that I've wanted to get since high school</li>
          <li>also like my friend's cat, he is so cute!🤩</li>
          <li>keep a lot of plants because I like the feeling of being surrounded by plants indoors🪴</li>
          <li>traveled several times recently. The Oze National Park I visited recently is very beautiful⛰️</li>
          <li>like lying on the lawn and soaking up the sun🏝️</li>
          <li>feel comfortable when I'm close to nature</li>
          <li>I also like the convenience and comfort brought by technology, as well as products of people's unlimited imagination</li>
          <li>as a feminist. I think about the injustices in society and strive to break free from the shackles of patriarchy, so that I and hopefully others too can live a happy and free life</li>
