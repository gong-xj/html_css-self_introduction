          <li>my biggest hobby is reading online novel. I've been reading about 15 million words of online novels every year, for more than 15 years📖</li>
          <li>other hobbies change quite fast. Once I am interested in something, I will concentrate on it day and night until I become almost the top level among amateurs in a short period of time. I'm especially good at handwork</li>
          <li>I enjoy time alone</li>
          <li>as a feminist. I think about the injustices in society and strive to break free from the shackles of patriarchy, so that I and hopefully others too can live a happy and free life</li>
